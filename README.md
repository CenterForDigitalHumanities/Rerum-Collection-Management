# Rerum-Collection-Management
A collection management and exhibition tool, allowing for the creation of ad hoc collections of distributed or even unknown resources.

This is not a tool for collections of things that you have. It is for things that you know. 
The typical workflow may look like this:

1. Find a record that is interesting;
2. Make it more interesting;
3. Share the result.

These results are most likely to be a collection of objects, but may be a single detail page. 
In some cases, the entity you are attempting to define may not exist on the Internet, so you will make a place for it.
