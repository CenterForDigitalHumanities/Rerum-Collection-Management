        Let's get something new. You can start with a link to a unique resource identifier (URI), 
        a well-described file (RDF-XML, JSON-LD), or just start with a new blank record.
        <a href="#adding-records" class="popover">learn more</a>
    </p>
    <button role="button">I have a URI<span>taco</span></button>
    <button role="button">I have a RDF address</button>
    <button role="button">I have an id for a JSON-LD file</button>
    <p>
        To start with just a page or image from the web, or to simply describe somethign that has 
        not been represented on the Internet, create soemthing new.
